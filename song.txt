Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
"Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
Once I was seven years old
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushin' each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By 11, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
"Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely"
Once I was 11 years old
I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
Somethin' about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old
